It shows the calculation of fuel weight fraction and hence fuel at different stages of flight. 
What you'll notice is that the total fuel weight fraction is calculated first, with respect to the total weight of the aircraft (initial maximum take-off weight). 
Then, by iteration, a ballpark MTOW is estimated. 
Then, using the fuel weight fraction that we already determined in the previous step, the weight of the fuel is calculated.
Now you'll proceed with component weight estimation using these values. 
The fuel weight fraction remains the same throughout because it depends only on range, endurance, aerodynamic efficiency, and specific fuel consumption. (SFC).
However, with the new weight estimated from the component weight estimation method, 
the weight of the fuel will be the fuel weight fraction (from the first step) multiplied by the new weight of the aircraft.
